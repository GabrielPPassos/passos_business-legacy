# Fivem Script: Business (Legacy Code)

## Overview

Welcome to the Business script for FiveM! This script provides a simple yet functional and engaging experience for players looking to dive into the world of business management within the FiveM roleplaying environment. It offers players the opportunity to establish and grow their own enterprises, with a blend of strategy, risk, and reward.

## Functionality

The script operates on a straightforward yet immersive premise. Players venture to the Life Invader establishment within the game to kickstart their entrepreneurial journey. Upon opening a company, they automatically initiate it at the lowest level, denoted as level zero. At this stage, players can only receive 50% of laundered money and witness a modest 25% increase in their funds.

However, the intrigue lies in the progression system. As players elevate their company through various levels, they progressively break through these initial limitations. Every 30 days, the player's capital experiences a multiplier effect corresponding to the current level of their enterprise. This mechanic encourages players to strategize and invest in their businesses for long-term prosperity.

## Regulatory Challenges

To add an extra layer of excitement and realism, the script introduces regulatory challenges in the form of law enforcement intervention. Police authorities can intervene in a player's business operations, exerting control by locking capital flow and preventing money laundering. In severe instances, they reserve the authority to permanently shut down a player's enterprise.
